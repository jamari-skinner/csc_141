# This one includes a paragraph about PEP 8 in code comments

# PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code. 
# It gives rules for things like how to name variables, how much spacing to use, and how to organize code so itâ€™s easier to read. 
# Following PEP 8 makes programs more consistent and helps other people understand your code quickly. 
# For example, it says to use lowercase letters with underscores for variable names, keep lines shorter than 79 characters, 
# and use blank lines to separate different parts of a program.

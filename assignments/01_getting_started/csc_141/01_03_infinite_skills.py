If I had infinitte programming skills, I'd try to be humble and just mod games and such.
To get risky though, I'd make a password decrypter or code decrypter.
Everything important to anyone has some type of code or guard, so everything would become open.
Lastly, Just erase my identity from the world, or make a fake one as a cover up just on case.
Just no consistencies.

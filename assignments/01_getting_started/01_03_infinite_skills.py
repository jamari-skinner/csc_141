If I had infinitte programming skills, I'd try to be humble and just mod games and such.
In the games, I'd mod games like Grand theft Auto, with loads of money and Experience for your rank.
To get risky though, I'd make a password decrypter or code decrypter.
Everything important to anyone has some type of code or guard, so everything would become open.
Lastly, Just erase my identity from the world, or make a fake one as a cover up just on case.
With no electronic footprint to connect to someone, I feel like it would jsut alot of 0's and 1's but a name, face, or SSN.
Im basically living as an invisible person.
Only way I can keep this though is jsut making sure everything stays different.
No consistencies unless needed.
